        <h2>Previous Experience</h2>
        <p><strong>Electrical Engineering Intern</strong> - Steel Dynamics (2024)</p>
        <p>During this internship I was tasked with working with an electrical engineer as a shadow to learn as much as possible.  I was also given a project where I was tasked with modernizing a set of PLC racks to a newer version for many reasons.  This project gave me insight into PLCs, working with real world people to complete a project, and real world experience in working on a project under a timeframe.  I learned much more from this internship than I could ever say in this paragraph, but this was just a few of the things I took from this internship</p>
